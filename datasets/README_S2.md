## Study Background: Post-Surgical Pain Management

Effective pain management after surgery is essential to enhance patient recovery and comfort. This study evaluates the effectiveness of three analgesics in reducing post-surgical pain levels in patients who underwent abdominal surgery. 

A total of **150 patients** were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments: **Paracetamol, Tramadol, or Dexketoprofen**. Pain levels were assessed **6 hours post-surgery** using a **Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10**, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst possible pain.

### Hypothesis

We hypothesize that **Tramadol and Dexketoprofen will provide similar pain relief**, while **Paracetamol will result in higher reported pain levels**. A **Kruskal-Wallis test** will be conducted to compare pain scores among the three groups, followed by a **Dunnâ€™s post-hoc test** to determine which treatments differ significantly.

If the results confirm that Paracetamol is less effective, clinical recommendations could favor the use of Tramadol or Dexketoprofen for post-surgical pain management.
