## Study Background: The InfectoScore Biomarker for Sepsis Severity

Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Early identification and stratification of sepsis severity are crucial for timely interventions and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we aim to evaluate **InfectoScore**, a novel inflammatory biomarker, as a potential tool for distinguishing between **mild, moderate, and severe sepsis**.

We collected data from **90 hospitalized patients** diagnosed with sepsis. Each patient underwent laboratory testing, including measurements of **C-reactive protein (CRP)**, **procalcitonin**, and **InfectoScore levels (ng/mL)**. Clinical parameters such as **age, SOFA score**, and **30-day mortality** were also recorded.

### Hypothesis

We hypothesize that **InfectoScore levels will be significantly different across sepsis severity groups**, with higher values in severe sepsis cases. A **Kruskal-Wallis test** will be performed to assess differences among groups, followed by a **Dunnâ€™s post-hoc test** to determine specific pairwise differences.

If **InfectoScore** proves to be a reliable biomarker for sepsis severity, it could become a valuable clinical tool for risk stratification and early intervention.
