## Study Background: Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Response to Treatment

Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor, and effective treatment strategies are essential for reducing morbidity and mortality. This study investigates the effect of a pharmacological intervention on **blood pressure reduction** and **cholesterol levels**. The dataset includes measurements taken before and after treatment for patients receiving either a **drug** or a **placebo**.

We collected data from **150 patients**, recording their **age, gender, treatment group**, and key clinical parameters such as **systolic and diastolic blood pressure** and **cholesterol levels**. The primary objective is to assess whether the drug effectively reduces systolic blood pressure compared to the placebo group.

### Hypothesis

We hypothesize that **patients receiving the drug will exhibit a significantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure** compared to those in the placebo group. Statistical tests such as **Wilcoxon rank-sum or Kruskal-Wallis** will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.

If the drug demonstrates a clinically meaningful reduction in blood pressure, it may be considered for further clinical trials as a potential treatment for hypertension.
