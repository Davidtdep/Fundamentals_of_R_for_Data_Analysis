# Proposal for the R Course Project

## 1. General Information

- **Course Title:** Fundamentals of R for Data Analysis.
- **Duration:** 5 weeks (5 sessions of 2 hours each).
- **Format:** In-person.
- **Target Audience:** University students interested in data management and statistical analysis.
- **Responsible Entity:**  
  - *Prometeus Biomedicina Aplicada a las Ciencias Clínicas*, Research Group, Universidad de Cartagena.  
  - *Center for Meta-Research and Scientometrics in Biomedical Sciences*, Barranquilla 500366, Colombia.  
- **Course Instructor:** David A. Hernandez-Paez, Medical Student.

## 2. Rationale

Every day, new knowledge is published, influencing multiple aspects of science, including clinical practices. Achieving excellence in these fields requires not only interpreting these findings but also critically evaluating how they are performed. Therefore, this course aims to provide a foundational understanding of statistical analysis, fostering in learners a rigorous criterion for assessing and applying scientific evidence effectively.

## 3. Objectives

### General Objective
- Train participants in the use of R for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### Specific Objectives
- Enhance data analysis capabilities among students.
- Promote the adoption of modern tools for scientific research.
- Establish the research group as a leading resource in training and skill development.

## 4. Course Content

### **Session 1: Introduction to R and RStudio**
- Installation and configuration of R and RStudio.
- Overview of RStudio environment and basic operations.
- Descriptive statistics and visualization using **ggplot2**:
  - Barplot, boxplot, chord plot, lineplot, and scatter plot.
- Setting up Git and GitHub accounts to track project progress.
- Introduction to resources for graphical inspiration:
  - R-Charts  
  - R Graph Gallery  

### **Session 2: Statistical Testing**
- Foundations of statistical significance and hypothesis testing.
- Performing basic statistical tests:
  - Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilk.
  - Chi-squared, Fisher’s exact test.
  - ANOVA, Student’s t-test, Kruskal-Wallis.
- Post-hoc testing:
  - Tukey’s test for ANOVA.
  - Dunn’s test for Kruskal-Wallis.
- Visualizing statistical results with significance annotations using **ggplot2**.

### **Session 3: Correlation and Regression**
- Calculating and interpreting correlations.
- Visualizing correlations with a heatmap using **pheatmap**.
- Introduction to regression modeling.
- Graphical representation of regression results in heatmaps.

### **Session 4: ROC Curves and Feedback**
- Creating and interpreting **ROC curves** in R.
- Course review and Q&A.
- Providing a dataset and research idea for optional projects:
  - Development of a poster for a conference or a manuscript for publication.
  - Confidentiality agreement within the research group until results are presented or published.

### **Session 5: Final Project**
- Comprehensive analysis of a real dataset related to the research group’s domain.
- Participants will have up to **3 weeks** to complete their projects.
- The instructor will be available in-person during the course's usual time and location throughout these 3 weeks to address questions and provide guidance.
- Presentation and peer evaluation of projects.

## 5. Methodology

- **Interactive Classes:** A blend of theoretical explanations and hands-on exercises.
- **Collaborative Projects:** Team-based problem-solving to tackle real-world challenges.
- **Platforms:** Use of **GitHub** for code management and collaboration.

## 6. Required Resources

- **Software:** Installation of **R** and **RStudio**.
- **Infrastructure:** Classroom equipped with computers.
- **Materials:** Slide decks and datasets.
